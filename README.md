# 100daysofpython
This is a repository for the projects featured in Angela Yu's '100 Days of Code' Python course.

## [Day 1](https://github.com/camjeffrey/100daysofpython/tree/main/day_1)
Day 1 begins quite simple, covering the basics of the **print()** and **input()** functions, simple errors and debugging, string concatenation, and variables.

The project for day 1 is a simple band name generator, which asks the user for two separate inputs: the name of the city they grew up in, and the name of their first pet. These inputs are each assigned to a variable and then concatenated.

Based on some knowledge I already had, I chose to use an fstring for the final output.
